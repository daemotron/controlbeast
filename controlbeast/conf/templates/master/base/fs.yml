# -- fs.yml
#
# This is ControlBeast's file system configuration file, used to describe the file system configuration
# for a host system managed by ControlBeast.
#
# This file's syntax follows the YAML 1.1 syntax specification (cf. http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/ for details).
# Lines starting with a hash sign (#) are considered as comments and therefore ignored.
#
# Important Note:
# As a general rule, all configuration designators shall be spelled in lower case letters.
#


# Hard disk configuration
#
# For each hard disk to be managed by ControlBeast, insert an adequate designation block, named by the respective
# device name and providing the following information:
#
# scheme:     partition scheme to be used (currently, GPT is the only supported scheme)
# align:      block size in bytes to be used for alignment
# partitions: mapping of partitions. Each partition block is opened by the partition's device name and provides
#             the following information:
#   type:       partition type (cf. examples for possible options)
#   size:       partition size; can be suffixed as per what the gpart command does understand. If none is indicated,
#               the remaining space on the disk device shall be allocated to this partition (i. e. subsequent partitions
#               will not be created!)
#   label:      label of the partition to be set

# Bootloader configuration
#
# Currently, only the ZFS boot loading scheme is supported
boot:
  loader: zfs
  pool: zroot


# File system layout configuration
#
# Currently, only ZFS based file system layouts are supported. For each Zpool to be managed by ControlBeast, insert an
# adequate designation block, named by the Zpool name and providing the following information:
#
# layout:     Zpool layout to be used (one of mirror, raidz1, raidz2, raidz3, ...)
# providers:  list of provider devices used to building the pool. The number of providers indicated must be compliant
#             with the selected Zpool layout
# datasets:   for each dataset to be created within the Zpool, insert an adequate designation block, named by the
#             ZFS dataset's name and providing the following information:
#   mountpoint:  mount point of the dataset
#   compress:    either a valid ZFS compression algorithm or false (no compression)
#   noatime:     set the noatime flag on the dataset if true
#   nosuid:      set the nosuid flag on the dataset if true
#   mode:        set the mountpoint to the indicated mode (octal notation method used)
