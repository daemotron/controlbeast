# -- system.yml
#
# This is ControlBeast's system configuration file, used to describe the system configuration
# for a host system managed by ControlBeast.
#
# This file's syntax follows the YAML 1.1 syntax specification (cf. http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/ for details).
# Lines starting with a hash sign (#) are considered as comments and therefore ignored.
#
# Important Note:
# As a general rule, all configuration designators shall be spelled in lower case letters.
#

# Operating system configuration.
#
# ControlBeast currently only supports the FreeBSD operating system with
# versions >= 9.2
#
os:
  type: FreeBSD
  version: 10.0

# Hard disk configuration
#
# For each hard disk to be managed by ControlBeast, insert and adequate designation block, named by the respective
# device name and providing the following information:
#
# scheme:     partition scheme to be used (currently, GPT is the only supported scheme)
# align:      block size in bytes to be used for alignment
# partitions: mapping of partitions. Each partition block is opened by the partition's device name and provides
#             the following information:
#   type:       partition type (cf. examples for possible options)
#   size:       partition size; can be suffixed as per what the gpart command does understand. If none is indicated,
#               the remaining space on the disk device shall be allocated to this partition (i. e. subsequent partitions
#               will not be created!)
#   label:      label of the partition to be set
