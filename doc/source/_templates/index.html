    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>
        ControlBeast is a command line based software helping <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> system
        administrators with automatizing repetitive tasks and managing all information related to a server's
        configuration in one place. ControlBeast has been developed with security in mind, but also following the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a> &ndash; unnecessary complexity has
        always been one of the most common sources for security issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        ControlBeast heavily relies on <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> to store all kinds of configuration
        information, making it easy to edit and also later <em>understand</em> them. This approach allows maintaining
        the whole configuration information within a version management system.
        <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, one of the most powerful distributed SCM systems has been chosen for
        this purpose, building a strong basis for many of ControlBeast's features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of features, among many others, the following ones offered by ControlBeast are probably worth
        mentioning:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Secure <strong>remote deployment</strong> mechanism via SSH ensures configuration integrity of the managed
            system
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bare metal (re&ndash;)install</strong> functionality allows cloning of an existing system onto a
            new machine, disaster recovery, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Support of FreeBSD's <strong>jails</strong> for virtualisation purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>
